Letâ€™s see how our AI Assistant can help you understand regulations and finish your paperwork.

It's easy to get started: just head to the [AI Assistant Tab](/tc-frontend/assistant) and you are greeted with a chatbox.

Enter your question and our AI Assistant will try to answer it. If it can't, it will ask you to rephrase your question.

It may take some time while the assistant browses through our database of regulations and tries to find the best answer for you.
